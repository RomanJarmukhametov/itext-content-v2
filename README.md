# Case Study: iText Translation Agency's New Website

## Background

iText Translation Agency has been a trusted name for professional translation services in Kazakhstan for 12 years. Aiming to attract businesses with specific translation needs, the website's objective is to convey the story of iText's skills and experience to its target audience: decision-makers in companies.

## Objective & Goals

The primary goal for the new website was to convert visitors into customers. With this in mind, two major KPIs were set:

1. Decrease the bounce rate.

2. Increase the conversion rate.

Post implementation, there was a significant **39% decrease** in the bounce rate and a **27% boost** in the conversion rate.

## Technical Approach

With a need for a flexible and modern framework, **Nuxt3** was chosen, especially for its _Server Side Rendering (SSR) capabilities_. **Nuxt3's i18n module** simplified the localization process, a critical requirement given the client's desire for language-specific, localized content. On the backend, **Nuxt Content v2** was the choice due to its powerful git-based CMS natures which provided a plethora of custom settings, allowing the client to offer specialized content tailored to specific languages. Integration of _Tailwind and vueuse/motion_ added to the technical robustness of the site.

## Outcomes

The newly implemented website met its stated goals, with the addition of a blog that greatly enhanced organic search traffic. Feedback from stakeholders was overwhelmingly positive, praising both the seamless communication during the project and the high-quality final result. One testimonial stated: "_Their process is seamless and their attention to detail unmatched - they come highly recommended_."

## Lessons & Future Prospects

This project solidified the notion that **Nuxt3 and Nuxt Content v2 are excellent choices for developing websites rooted in JAMstack architecture**. While all initial objectives have been met, there's potential in the future to integrate a chatbot, possibly leveraging technology like ChatGPT.

## Conclusion

iText Translation Agency's website ([https://itext.agency](https://itext.agency/)) stands as a testament to the power of combining Nuxt3 and Strapi for a high-performance, tailored user experience. With substantial improvements in bounce and conversion rates, the platform showcases how modern technologies can significantly elevate an online presence.# itext-nuxt-content
